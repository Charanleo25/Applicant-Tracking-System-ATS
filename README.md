# Applicant-Tracking-System-ATS-
This python-based project mainly aims to help companies organize candidates for hiring and recruitment purposes. These systems allow businesses to collect information, organize prospects based on experience and skill set, and filter applicants. This is for recruiters and students to get better results by meeting their expectations without any cost factor and thus helping the people expose how the company ATS works.
